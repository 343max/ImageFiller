#Image Filler

## Introduction

Quickly fills your iPhones Photo Album with thousands of random images from [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com).

Note that this is a fork from [343max's ImageFiller](https://github.com/343max/ImageFiller) project. The only difference between this one and the original is that this one creates albums after fetching and saving images to the phone.

Somtimes you just need a few thousand images in your iPhones photo album to test an image gallery or something. ImageFiller just fills your iOS Photo Album with random images from lorempixel.com. The dates of these images will be random dates from the last 5ish years.

**Only run this on test devices and the simulator if you can wipe the device afterwards. Don't use it on a photo stream enabled device.**
